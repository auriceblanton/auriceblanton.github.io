                 <h3>Sound Wave</h3>

                <p> Sound wave is a project that we are working on. The purpose of this project is to send out a strong message with a 3D peice of art. T
                he quote I am sending is "America Rapes The People" This quote was created from random words. 
                I used this quote because I felt when people hear it they will want to know more about it.
                The quote is referring to the amount of money the goverment and state takes from everyone.
                We are not going to use paint but a stain. Stain will allow the texture of the wood to show on each one. </p>

                 <h3>Sound Wave 2nd Idea</h3>

                <p> The stain idea didnt work. We decided to go from stain to paint. We feel that paint would look better and dry stronger. 
                Our second idea is to take different shades of green to represent money. The greens will help the audience relate the quote with money. 
                We chose to use 5 greens that we feel fit with each other. </p>
