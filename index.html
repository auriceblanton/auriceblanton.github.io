                 <h3>Art</h3>

                <p>On this photo I am working on a piece that I have started in art 1.
                The project is showing a 3D version of a sound wave. The sound wave came from a statement that I recorded. 
                I brought it to life because I felt like this was a powerful statement. The statement I used was "America rapes The people"
                it refers to how much money they take from us.. <a href="mailto:"></a> </p>

                 <h3>World Studies</h3>

                <p>In this class we had to create a poster to help get soldiers to fight in a 
                battle. The poster had to be recreated from the original and change all the lies into truths. 
                In the poster we had to have one center symbol to represent the group fighting.</p>

                <p>This is a picture of my current project in english 3.  
                In english 3 we created a book with our defining moments as the topic.
                Each person had a job to help create the book. My job was to create a cover page and write my own defining moment.</p>
